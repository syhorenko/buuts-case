Intro:
    
    Create a small test app with a list of locations. Your app should fetch the locations from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abnamrocoesd/assignment-ios/main/locations.json
Once opened, the app should show the list of locations in a list view.
The use of UIKit is mandatory as a foundation, but a small amount of SwiftUI is allowed.â€™
